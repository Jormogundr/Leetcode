# Leetcode

This repo is meant to allow me to work on Leetcode problems seamlessly as I move between devices. 

In general, my workflow is currently:

- Select a problem (work through https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)
- Write a Python3 implementation - work out any bugs, and run test cases.
- Find ways to optimize space/time complexity that improve over initial implementation.
- Convert the program in C++.
