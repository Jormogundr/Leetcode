# Leetcode

This repo is meant to allow me to work on Leetcode problems seamlessly as I move between devices. 

In general, my workflow is currently:

- Select a problem (working through 'Easy' first until they're too easy).
- Write a Python3 implementation - work out any bugs.
- Find ways to optimize space/time complexity.
- Rewrite the program in C++.

CURRENTLY WORKING ON: Easy/13. Roman To Integer c++ implementation
