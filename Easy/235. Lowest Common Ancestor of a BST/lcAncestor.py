"""
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1E5].
-1E9 <= Node.val <= 1E9
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.
